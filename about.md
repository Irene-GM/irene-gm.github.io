I am a Computer Science engineer with an MSc in Geospatial Technologies that dared to delve into the depths of the Machine Learning Universe during my PhD, and actually liked it! During my professional career my profile evolved from GIS software developer to Data Scientist. I currently work at the Dutch Met Office (KNMI), investigating how data provided by citizen weather stations modelled with machine learning methods can help at achieving a higher spatio-temporal resolution of the current weather products. This is important to assess at a fine resolution the potential impact that severe weather events have in our society. Before this, I worked as a researcher at the ITC - University of Twente, focusing in the application of machine learning methods to model Lyme disease, using citizen science data.
